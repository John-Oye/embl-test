Each cancer has a unique combination of genetic changes, and as the cancer continues to grow additional changes will occur. Gene expression profile may be used to find and diagnose a disease or condition or to see how well the body responds to treatment. Depending on the goal several methods can be used to measure gene expression. Researchers use patient-derived cancer models – that is models made from cells from patients with cancer – to test their hypothesis of why cells turn cancerous and to identify specific treatment that stops them.`;
